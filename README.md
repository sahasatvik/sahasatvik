### Hey there!

I'm a newly admitted graduate student in the PhD Program at the Department of Statistics, Columbia University.
I'm still learning basic web design as well as programming with Python, C, and Java.
I'm also an amateur chess player, speedcuber and violinist.

Find me at my [personal website](https://sahasatvik.github.io), or drop me an [email](mailto:sahasatvik@gmail.com).  
How about a nice game of [chess](https://lichess.org/@/sahasatvik)?
